# Geo-visualization of Earthquakes in Indian Subcontinent 

Earthquakes occur along fault lines, cracks in Earth's crust where tectonic plates meet. Scientists describe the intensity of an earthquake using the Richter Scale. It measures earthquakes on a scale of 1 to 10. People barely feel a magnitude 3 earthquake . A magnitude 6 or above earthquake is considered a major one can cause major Damage. 

Based on the past seismic history, Bureau of Indian Standards grouped the country into four seismic zones namely Zone-II, Zone-III, Zone-IV and Zone-V. Of all these four zones, Zone-V is the most seismic active region whereas Zone-II is the least.

In this repository we will try to visualize the data provide by the National Center for Seismology Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India. And try to Analyze various aspects from the given data.
